      <p>In May 2023 we delivered a talk for the Henry Royce Institute <a href="https://www.royce.ac.uk/students/stand-out-skills/" target="_blank">Stand Out Skills webinar series</a>. Websites are a great way to promote yourself, your research, or other projects you participate in. Adapting one of the many freely available website templates allows you to build a personal brand and communicate effectively.
      In this talk, Lucy walked us through how to set up a free, static (non-interactive) website using Github Pages and highlighted some effective examples from materials science research.</p>

      <p>In January 2023 we hosted the first Rising Stars in Materials Science Workshop at the Henry Royce Institute. This full day event combined career skills workshops, creative networking activities and a carefully selected Q & A panel of experts. It was supported by the <a href="https://www.rsc.org/" target="_blank">Royal Society of Chemistry</a>, <a href="https://www.forwomeninscience.com/" target="_blank">L'Oreal</a> and the <a href="https://www.royce.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Henry Royce Institute</a>.</p>
