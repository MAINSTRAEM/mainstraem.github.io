        <p>Rising Stars celebrates and supports the rising stars within underrepresented groups in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) subjects.  It is a grassroots initiative led by researchers in the UK Materials Science community, and is primarily targeted at Early Career Researchers (whether PhD student, post-doc or faculty) in Materials Science.</p>
        <p>Our aim is to support researchers to not only work but to thrive in their research community, to address the diversity gap within STEM research, and to enhance the diversity of thought and innovation.</p>
        <p>Each year we hold a Rising Stars workshop in partnership with the Henry Royce Institute. Priority registration is given to historically marginalised groups, and funding for travel and/or caring responsibilities is available to aid accessibility. For more information see our <a href="./upcoming.html">upcoming</a> or <a href="./previous.html">previous</a> events.</p>
